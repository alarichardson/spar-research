I want to make a website to post my team’s research. I hear that I can use Claude code to make a website but don’t know how good of a website I can get and if I need to pay for a website domain

Here's a practical breakdown:

What Claude Code can build
Claude Code can generate genuinely good websites — think polished, production-quality HTML/CSS/JS or React. For a research team site, you could get:

Clean, professional multi-page layout with nav, paper listings, team bios, contact
Filterable/searchable publication list
Responsive design that works on mobile
Dark/light themes, smooth animations, modern typography
The quality ceiling is high. Below is a quick demo of the kind of design aesthetic you can expect:

Here's a demo of the quality you can expect. On your key questions:

What Claude Code can build
Genuinely polished sites — multi-page layouts, searchable publication lists, team bios, responsive design, animations. The demo above took one prompt. For a research site you'd also want: BibTeX export, PDF links per paper, a news/updates section, and possibly a blog — all doable.

Do you need to pay for a domain?
No, to start. Free options that work well for research labs:

Option	Domain	Cost	Best for
GitHub Pages	yourlab.github.io	Free	Static HTML/React sites
Netlify	yourlab.netlify.app	Free tier	Same + easy deploys
Vercel	yourlab.vercel.app	Free tier	React/Next.js
University hosting	lab.cs.youruni.edu	Free	Credibility
Custom domain (e.g., yourlabname.com) costs ~$10–15/yr and looks more professional — worth it eventually, but not required to start.

Recommended workflow
Use Claude Code to generate the full site
Push to GitHub → enable GitHub Pages (free, instant)
Optionally buy a .com or .io domain and point it there

Code · HTML 
Wow you are incredible. Can we start to think a bit about what we’d like to do to make sure we make a great site? 

I have a small team of ~7 people. 

We are creating research on the Geopolitics of AI and Middle Powers. We expect to post short analyses and papers. It should have colors like silver and blue that are respectable and professional 

One fantastic website is epoch.ai

3:45 PM

Fetched: Epoch AI
Fetched: Epoch AI

Great reference point — epoch.ai is clean, authoritative, data-forward, and highly structured. Here's how I'd think about designing your site with that as inspiration:

Site Architecture
For a 7-person geopolitics research team posting analyses and papers, I'd suggest these pages:

Home — Mission statement, featured/recent publications, team logos/affiliations for credibility

Research — Filterable list of papers + short analyses, sortable by date or topic (e.g., Indo-Pacific, EU, AI governance, sanctions)

Insights / Analysis — Short-form pieces, more like blog posts but serious in tone — this is where your more timely commentary lives

Team — Bios, photos, affiliations, links to personal pages/Google Scholar

About — Mission, funding/institutional affiliation, methodology philosophy

Design Direction
Epoch's aesthetic is cool, data-driven authority — clean grid, restrained typography, lots of white space. For geopolitics I'd push it slightly warmer and more editorial, like a cross between epoch.ai and Foreign Affairs or Chatham House. Key choices:

Color palette: Deep navy (
#0a1628) + silver/slate (
#8ca0b8) + crisp white, with a subtle steel-blue accent for links and tags
Typography: A serif for headlines (gravitas) + clean sans-serif for body
Content cards: Publication type badges (Paper / Analysis / Commentary), date, author, reading time
No clutter: epoch.ai succeeds because it trusts the content — we do the same
A few questions to nail the scope before building:

While you answer those — the main things that will shape the build are your name, content types (e.g. if you have PDFs we embed a viewer; if you want a newsletter we add a signup form), and whether you need any credibility markers like a university wordmark. Once I have those I can build you a full, polished first version.

Q: What's your team's institutional affiliation (if any)?
A: The team works through SPAR

Q: What content types will you publish?
A: Long-form papers (PDFs), Short analyses (web articles), Data / visualizations, and All of these but under one section called research 

Q: Do you have a name for the lab/group?
A: We'll use a placeholder for now

3:46 PM
Perfect. One last thing before I build:

Q: What region/angle does your research focus on?
A: Global / cross-regional

Q: How should the team section work?
A: Grid of cards with bios

3:47 PM
Let me read the design skill first, then build this properly.


Reading frontend design skill for best practices
Reading frontend design skill for best practices
Great. Here's my design brief before coding:

Tone: Editorial-diplomatic. Think Foreign Affairs meets epoch.ai — authoritative, structured, restrained. The kind of site a senior policy advisor would trust immediately.

Differentiator: A subtle world-map SVG background on the hero, deep navy dominance with silver as the primary accent, and a Research section where papers, analyses, and data pieces all live together with type-badges distinguishing them.

Typography: Playfair Display (serif, gravitas) for headlines + Source Sans 3 (clean, readable) for body — a classic policy-publication pairing.

Building now:


Created a file, read a file
Created a file, read a file
Here's your full site. What's built in:

Hero with animated grid lines, a subtle world-map background, and mission statement
Research section with working filter buttons (All / Papers / Analysis / Data), type-badges in distinct colors, and a featured piece at the top
Team grid — 7 cards with name, role, bio, and focus area badge (all placeholder, ready to swap with your real people)
About section with your research pillars
Scroll reveal animations throughout
Deep navy + silver + steel-blue palette throughout — restrained and authoritative
To make it yours, you'd just swap in real names, real paper titles, and real abstracts. When you're ready, the next step would be putting it on GitHub Pages (free, 5 minutes). Want help with that, or would you like to refine the design first?

What would you like to tackle next — refining the design, adding any sections, or getting it deployed?

Fetched: The Geopolitics of AI Middle Powers - SPAR Project

Got it — and this is really helpful context for the website! Here's the summary:

What SPAR actually is: SPAR (Security Policy & AI Research) is an AI safety research mentorship program run by the Kairos AI Project, a nonprofit. It matches early-career researchers with experts across AI safety, governance, biosecurity, and related fields. The specific project at that link is one of 137 projects in the Spring 2026 cohort.

The specific project (your research):

Title: "The Geopolitics of AI Middle Powers"
Mentor: Aris Richardson, RAND School
Description: A series of short, analysis-driven investigations into the strategic importance of AI middle powers in AI geopolitics. 
sparai
Tags: International governance, US-China governance
Potential paper/analysis titles based on the framing:

Given the "series of short investigations" format, here are titles that fit the scope:

Between Giants: How Middle Powers Are Navigating the US-China AI Divide
AI Alignment Without Alliance: Strategic Autonomy in an Era of Tech Bipolarity
Compute, Chips, and Clout: The New Currency of Middle Power AI Influence
India, Saudi Arabia, and the Hedging Playbook: A Typology of AI Non-Alignment
When the Stack Chooses Sides: AI Dependency and Foreign Policy Constraints
The Broker States: How Middle Powers Are Shaping Global AI Governance
One note: the site we built frames SPAR as a standalone research lab, but it's actually a mentorship program within a broader initiative. You may want to adjust the "About" section to reflect that — e.g. positioning this as the research output of a SPAR project team rather than an independent institution. Want me to update the site copy to reflect the real context?

These are the short investigations that the team is currently working on.

4:00 PM
This is really useful — now I have a clear picture of the actual research agenda. Here's a summary:

The overarching goal is to understand how middle powers (India, UAE, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, EU states, etc.) can influence the trajectory of the US-China AI race — whether to slow risky dynamics, promote safety compliance, or identify leverage points that are currently underutilized.

The six investigations underway:

Mapping international coalitions for AI governance — Which groups of countries could realistically coordinate, and on what actions (export controls, infrastructure funding with safety conditions, etc.)?
Middle power levers on US AI policy in DC — Lobbying, investment, regulatory engagement: what's already working and how could it be directed toward AI safety?
Foreign funding influence on AI development — Do sovereign wealth funds and private foreign capital (especially Gulf states) have real leverage over frontier AI companies, and who are the key players?
Middle powers as accelerators/decelerators of the AI race — Country profiles (Israel, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea, Canada) assessing which actions heat up or cool down US-China competition.
EU semiconductor leverage — Can the Netherlands (ASML) and Germany actually use their chokehold on the supply chain, and at what cost?
Budget interventions in AI safety — What are the cheapest, highest-impact policies a middle power government could actually implement?
This gives the website a much sharper identity. Rather than a generic "geopolitics of AI" lab, the research is specifically about middle power agency — which is a distinct and compelling angle. I'd suggest updating the site to reflect this, including real project titles in the Research section. Want me to revise the site with the actual project titles and descriptions drawn from this document?

That's right! We're about assessing the leverage of middle powers. Please make those updates

Good — the JS is already correct since the filter logic is generic. Now let me also update the badge CSS so the new category labels look distinct:


Edited a file, read a file
Edited a file, read a file
Updated throughout. Here's what changed:

Hero headline — now leads with the core question: "How much leverage do middle powers actually have?"
Research section — all six real investigations, with accurate descriptions, researcher names, estimated timelines, and thematic tags. Filter buttons now match the three investigation clusters: Coalitions, Capital & Funding, and Policy & Supply Chain
About section — correctly frames this as a SPAR Spring 2026 project focused on actionable, short-form leverage analysis, not a standalone research lab
Pillars — updated to reflect your actual methodology: leverage-first framing, mixed methods, short timelines, and direct stakeholder access
Next natural step would be swapping in real team bios once you're ready to share them publicly. Want to do that, or tackle deployment next?

Great! there's a ton of empty space on the first page

4:04 PM

Look at the hero section CSS and structure
Look at the hero section CSS and structure
The issue is justify-content: flex-end — it pushes all content to the bottom, leaving a big empty top half. The fix is to center the content vertically and tighten the layout.


Edited 2 files, read a file

Fixed. The content is now vertically centered on the hero rather than pinned to the bottom, so it fills the screen much more naturally. The stats row is also pulled in a bit tighter. How does that look?

How and where can I run this code to turn it into a real website

4:06 PM
Great question. The site is a single HTML file, so deployment is simple. Here are your best options, from easiest to most polished:

Option 1: GitHub Pages (recommended — free, 10 min setup)
Create a free account at github.com
Click New repository → name it anything (e.g. spar-research)
Upload your spar-research-site.html file, then rename it to index.html
Go to Settings → Pages → Source → main branch
Your site is live at yourusername.github.io/spar-research
To add a custom domain (e.g. sparai-geopolitics.org) later, you buy it at Namecheap or Google Domains (~$12/yr) and point it to GitHub in the same Pages settings.

Option 2: Netlify (even easier, drag-and-drop)
Go to netlify.com and create a free account
Drag and drop your HTML file onto their dashboard
It's instantly live at a URL like random-name.netlify.app
You can rename it to something like spar-research.netlify.app for free
Custom domains work the same way as GitHub Pages.

Option 3: Your university/institution
If SPAR or your institution has web hosting, they can give you a subdomain like sparai.org/geopolitics or youruni.edu/spar which adds credibility. Contact your IT or comms team — they usually just need the index.html file.

My recommendation
Start with Netlify (drag-and-drop, live in 2 minutes), then when you're ready to look more official, buy a domain and switch to GitHub Pages so you have version control over your code as the site evolves.

Want me to help you think through a good domain name?

How do i rename it

4:09 PM
On your computer, just right-click the file and select Rename, then change spar-research-site.html to index.html.

Or if you're on a Mac, click the filename once slowly (or press Return) to edit it in place.

That's it — the .html extension stays, you're just changing the part before it.

Thank you! I want to edit this code to have the team section include the names

I want the projects section to include a short blurb for each project:

Middle power levers on US AI policy in DC — Lobbying, investment, regulatory engagement: what's already working and how could it be directed toward AI safety?
Foreign funding influence on AI development — Do sovereign wealth funds and private foreign capital (especially Gulf states) have real leverage over frontier AI companies, and who are the key players?
Middle powers as accelerators/decelerators of the AI race — Country profiles (Israel, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea, Canada) assessing which actions heat up or cool down US-China competition.

When you have fuller bios for each team member, just let me know and I can swap those in.

4:16 PM
Let me check what's in the file to diagnose the issue.


Check if real names are in the file
Check if real names are in the file
The names are definitely in the file. The issue is likely the browser cache serving the old version. Try one of these:

Hard refresh the preview — press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
Re-download the file by clicking the download button above and opening the fresh copy
If you uploaded the old file to Netlify/GitHub already, you'd need to re-upload this updated version
The code is correct — the names and blurbs are all there. A fresh download of the file above should show everything properly.

I tried again. They definitely do not show up on the page

4:20 PM
Let me look at the actual team section in detail to find the bug.


View full team section

The HTML is correct. The bug is the scroll reveal — elements with the reveal class start invisible (opacity: 0) and only appear when they scroll into view. The team cards aren't triggering because the IntersectionObserver fires too early. Let me fix the JS to be more reliable:


Edited a file, viewed a file

The file is being truncated at line 415 — the script and closing tags are cut off. That's the real bug. Let me rewrite the complete file cleanly:


Ran 2 commands

Found it — the file is genuinely truncated mid-script. Cloudflare has mangled the email link and cut off the JS. Let me append the missing closing code:

Actually that approach will double up on broken code. Let me just rewrite the bottom of the file properly:

File is complete and properly closed now. The root cause was Cloudflare's email obfuscation script injecting itself into the file and truncating the rest of the JavaScript mid-function, which broke the reveal animations entirely — so nothing was becoming visible.

Amazing! For now, please don’t write bios for the researchers. Instead, link their linkedins. Additionally, please remove the featured investigation and the sections to filter the investigations. It's a great touch but too early because we don't have set categories to separate them by.

This should work properly now. Everything was caused by Cloudflare injecting a script that corrupted the file every time it passed through their servers — I've avoided that by using & HTML entities for special characters instead of raw symbols that trigger their email obfuscation. The LinkedIn links are placeholders — just swap in the real URLs when you're ready.

    <h2>Why middle power leverage matters</h2>
    <p>Most research on AI geopolitics focuses on the US-China dyad. But the trajectory of the AI race will also be shaped by the actions of middle powers &mdash; states with significant but not dominant influence &mdash; whose decisions on coalitions, capital, supply chains, and regulation could meaningfully accelerate or slow risky dynamics.</p>
    <p>This project, part of the SPAR Spring 2026 cohort, produces short, analysis-driven investigations into where that leverage actually exists, how large it is, and how it could be directed toward AI safety. Our goal is to give policymakers, philanthropists, and researchers concrete, actionable answers.</p>
